#+TITLE: My Julia Megarepo

This repository contains my simulation course exercises and other experimentations. I am generally using it as my Julia scratchpad. I'll refactor out some of its parts when I should have the time.

The things of interest in it currently include:

* An elaborate infectious disease model (which is remarkable in that it runs in a continuous mode, unlike most simulations that run in discrete steps)

** Quickstart: The Infectious Disease Model

You need Julia v1.5 installed. You can copy my environment from this [[https://github.com/NightMachinary/.shells/tree/0227fb3a76f963137b6c21834ba391d673ce8053/.julia/environments/v1.5][commit]]. The =.julia= directory needs to be in your =HOME= directory (i.e., at =~/.julia=).

The model was tested with this [[https://github.com/batbone/stochastic/tree/9e3d3d5bbbb2c8975a1dc68aed9ef565c79534db][commit]], though I recommend just using the latest commit. Do not use the readme from that commit, always use the latest master commit for the readme.

- Go to the project directory:
  ~cd ./project/~
- Start a Julia REPL:
  ~julia~
- Source the code:
  ~include("./prj.jl")~
- Now you can run the models. There are a few sample runs with the command that runs them in the project's Telegram [[https://t.me/InfectiousModel][channel]], since Github doesn't show videos. I have also included a few screenshots below.

* A happily-colored ising model

The code is at [[file:exercises/ising.jl]]. The generated pictures and videos are at [[file:art/ising/]].

* An image redrawing filter using Poisson processes

The code needs refactoring, it's currently at [[file:jo3/pprocessTest.jl][line 108, @plot drawP2D(G=(Î») -> imgrate ...]]. You can see examples at [[file:art/2d/]]. Most generated files have the code that generated them as their filename, or in a companion file with the same name as them. These code fragments might still have used an older API or a global variable, so they might not be copy-pasteable.
